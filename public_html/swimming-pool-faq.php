      <h2>Swimming Pool Frequently Asked Questions </h2>
      <img src="https://sacpoolpros.com/images/gallery/Phosphates-in-Swimming-Pools.jpg" alt="Solar cover" class="img-responsive">
   <p> <strong>Q: Why should I consider a custom pool instead of working with one of the pool companies that advertises attractively low prices?</strong><br>
A: It is important to understand what is included in a low-priced pool. Our swimming pool construction process goes beyond a one-size-fits-all approach. Once construction of a pool has begun, another swimming pool contractor may encounter issues that require additional costs to assure stability and durability. Our team starts the process of developing the budget for your pool by taking into consideration the features you desire and the construction needs for the area in which the pool will be built. You will have a good idea about cost before we break ground.
 </p>
<p> <strong>Q: Does your company provide financing?</strong><br>
A: Yes. We encourage you to look at the financing packages we offer and utilize the one that best fits your needs.</p>
<p> <strong>Q: How about pool warranties? Do you stand behind your pools?</strong><br>
A: The investment you make in a swimming pool is significant, and our reputation as a swimming pool builder depends on standing behind our work. Therefore, our company offers a warranty that reflects the confidence we have in the quality of our swimming pool construction. You will receive a lifetime structural warranty as well as a limited-time equipment warranty and one-year full warranty.</p>

<p> <strong>Q: How long will it take to build my pool?</strong><br>
A: The time frame for swimming pool construction can vary based on season and weather, but our swimming pool builders typically plan on 6-12 weeks from start to finish. Other factors that may impact schedule are ground conditions, accessibility to pool site and complexity of pool features selected. While we cannot control certain factors, we pledge to stay on schedule as closely as possible and keep you updated on delays affecting anticipated completion.</p>
<p> <strong>Q: How much cost for maintenance is required with a new pool?</strong><br>
A: The cost will vary depending on choice of professional pool service or owner maintenance of the pool. Pool services generally offer several levels of care, and prices range from $50 to $100 per month. Continual advances in technology provide ease of ownership through pre-programmed chemical balance programs, automated cleaners and sanitizing tools. We are happy to share reputable pool service company information.</p>

		  <h3>What people are saying</h3>
			<strong>"Just wanted to extend my gratitude for the work that was done by your employee last Thursday at 2841 Knollwood.  We had an unknown amount of dirt and mud that had gotten into our pool and he took his time to make sure it was all removed, after a couple days of running the filter our pool is back to normal.  Your company was extremely easy to work with from the first phone call to the work being completed.  I will recommend you to anyone I speak with and if I do ever decide to start regular pool service, I will be calling you."</strong>
