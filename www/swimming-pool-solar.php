     	<p>Solar Pool Heating offers pool owners an overall longer, MORE enjoyable pool season. Just think; more family pool time, more pool parties with friends, more exercise swim time - ALL with FREE heat from the SUN!</p>
      	<p>Call today and let us show you how Solar Pool Heating can help transform your swimming pool into that backyard getaway you&rsquo;ve always wanted.</p>
      	<p>CLEAN &amp; SIMPLE Solar Pool Heating works off of your existing pool pump. When heat can be gained, water is circulated through the solar pool panels and is warmed by the sun. The warm solar pool water returns to your pool through the existing pool plumbing</p>
      	<p>DIVE IN AND ENJOY! Solar swimming pool heaters cost absolutely nothing to operate, since energy from the sun is FREE. And because the system is fully automatic and has few moving parts, it is virtually maintenance-free. Solar powered pool heaters are also 100% eco-friendly. All you need to do is set the temperature and enjoy warm water for a much longer swim season without worrying about your energy bill or hurting the environment.</p>

		  <h3>What people are saying</h3>		  
			<strong>"Just wanted to extend my gratitude for the work that was done by your employee last Thursday at 2841 Knollwood.  We had an unknown amount of dirt and mud that had gotten into our pool and he took his time to make sure it was all removed, after a couple days of running the filter our pool is back to normal.  Your company was extremely easy to work with from the first phone call to the work being completed.  I will recommend you to anyone I speak with and if I do ever decide to start regular pool service, I will be calling you."</strong>
