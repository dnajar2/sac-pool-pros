		  <h3>What people are saying</h3>		  
			<strong>"Just wanted to extend my gratitude for the work that was done by your employee last Thursday at 2841 Knollwood.  We had an unknown amount of dirt and mud that had gotten into our pool and he took his time to make sure it was all removed, after a couple days of running the filter our pool is back to normal.  Your company was extremely easy to work with from the first phone call to the work being completed.  I will recommend you to anyone I speak with and if I do ever decide to start regular pool service, I will be calling you."</strong>
