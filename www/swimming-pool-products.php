						The pool control panel is physically located somewhere, but you no longer have to manually change it to control things like temperature, jets, lights, water features and more.&nbsp;IAQUALINK&nbsp;allows you to control your pool and/or spa wirelessly with your Apple or Android device, or computer.<br><br>
						The system includes many advanced features. The Eco Select setting allows you to conserve energy and water, making your pool more energy efficiency,&nbsp;while the History page tracks your past settings and usages so you can easily see if things have gotten off-course.<br><br>
						IAQUALINK provides the ultimate in convenience and data to keep your pool operating safely and efficiently.

						<h3>LIGHTS: SPECTRUM 360 LED LIGHTS</h3>
						<div>
						LED lights are an optional upgrade in any pool or spa. They are more energy efficient, and come in a wide array of colors (16 unique colors and 5 light shows) and styles.
						</div>
						</div>

						<div>
						<h3>PUMPS: JANDY PUMPS</h3>
						Every pool and spa requires a pump. Jandy pool and water pumps are the result of more than 40 years of engineering excellence and experience. Each pump provides energy efficient, quiet operation, and a long useful life. Unlike some traditional variable speed pumps that thread down to a 2" nipple for connection Jandy uses unions which makes pump a lot more accessible if a problem is to occur also the Jandy 2hp pump moves more water then a 3hp of any other brand!&nbsp;</div>
						<hr>
						<h3>HEATERS</h3>
						<div dir="ltr">A pool water heater will enable you to get the maximum value out of your pool investment by allowing you to enjoy the most comfortable water temperatures possible. A heater allows you to start your swimming season earlier and extend it later into the year and can lengthen your swimming day. Finally, a heater is considered a good investment, increasing the value and cost efficiency of your pool year after year.</div>
