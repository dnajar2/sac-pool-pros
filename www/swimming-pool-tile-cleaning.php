      <p>Sac Pool Pros can make your swimming pool tiles look new again this process takes about 2-3 hours varies on pool size and how much tile your pool will be required to be drained down below the tile line and then we will get in your swimming pool and use our state of the art soda blasting technology to clean your swimming pool tiles the chemical we use is soda ash it is very friendly to your swimming pool water and won't take away from your swimming time it will be vacuumed out as soon as we are done cleaning your tiles we will also adjust any chemical changes that may happen in the pool water since soda ash tends to raise your pH &amp; ALK levels it will be tested and adjusted after job is finished.<br>

		  <h3>What people are saying</h3>		  
			<strong>"Just wanted to extend my gratitude for the work that was done by your employee last Thursday at 2841 Knollwood.  We had an unknown amount of dirt and mud that had gotten into our pool and he took his time to make sure it was all removed, after a couple days of running the filter our pool is back to normal.  Your company was extremely easy to work with from the first phone call to the work being completed.  I will recommend you to anyone I speak with and if I do ever decide to start regular pool service, I will be calling you."</strong>
