      <p>If maintaining your pool has gotten out from under you or you have recently purchased a foreclosure or a home where the pool was neglected during the sales process, you are most likely looking at a green swamp that will be in need of a cleanup.</p>
      <p>Some pools will be able to be brought back to clear condition without draining depending on the severity and length of time the pool has sat in a green state. If you can&rsquo;t see the bottom of the pool, it will probably need to be drained and have the surfaces cleaned of extensive algae buildup before refilling can be done.</p>

      </div>      
      <p>The extent of the cleanup process will depend on pool condition. Chlorine washing alone may be enough to remove algae buildup but often an acid wash will also be required to remove accumulated staining for pool walls. Every case is different and often taken in steps.</p>
      <p>Tile cleaning or water line pebble can also be cleaned of calcium buildup.</p>

		  <h3>What people are saying</h3>		  
			<strong>"Just wanted to extend my gratitude for the work that was done by your employee last Thursday at 2841 Knollwood.  We had an unknown amount of dirt and mud that had gotten into our pool and he took his time to make sure it was all removed, after a couple days of running the filter our pool is back to normal.  Your company was extremely easy to work with from the first phone call to the work being completed.  I will recommend you to anyone I speak with and if I do ever decide to start regular pool service, I will be calling you."</strong>
